## Description
This application involved using third-party APIs to build a weather dashboard that runs in the browser. Local storage was used to store any persistent data. I used the OpenWeatherMap API to create a 5 Day Weather Forecast to retrieve weather data for cities.

## Installation 
Clone or Download as a zip file via GitHub

## Usage 
Simply right click on the "index.html" file and click "Open in deafult browser". This will now open the application in your browser. Type a city name in the search bar and the current weather as well as the 5 day forecast will be displayed. You can search up multiple cities and have them saved under the search input so you can easily access the same cities again.
